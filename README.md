Airline Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning
Introduction
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on customer feedback for major US airlines using deep learning techniques. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves understanding the emotions and opinions expressed in text data. In the context of the airline industry, analyzing customer feedback is crucial for improving services, identifying pain points, and making data-driven decisions.

The primary objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback data collected from sources like social media. By classifying the sentiment of these texts into positive, negative, or neutral categories, we aim to gain insights into customer satisfaction and identify areas that require attention.

Project Components
The project consists of the following components:

Data Collection: Gathering customer feedback data from various sources to create a diverse and representative dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the raw text data to make it suitable for deep learning. This includes tasks such as text cleaning, tokenization, and removing stopwords.

Deep Learning Model: Developing and training a deep learning model for sentiment analysis. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the deep learning model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and fine-tuning it if necessary.

Visualization: Creating visualizations to summarize the sentiment analysis model's performance and key insights from the data.

Recommendations: Based on the sentiment analysis results, generating actionable recommendations for the airline company.


Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries. You can install them by running:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Data
The project uses two data sources:

Tweets.csv: A CSV file containing the raw tweet data.

database.sqlite: A relational database storing the tweet data.

3. Run the Project
The core of this project is the Sentiment Analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. It contains all the code for data preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and visualization. You can open and run this notebook in a Jupyter environment to reproduce the analysis.

Conclusion
Airline sentiment analysis with deep learning is a powerful approach for understanding customer opinions and making data-driven decisions to enhance the overall customer experience. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can effectively analyze airline customer feedback using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and provide valuable insights.
